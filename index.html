<h1> Scenario: </h1>
<div class = " heading2"> 
<h2>   You are wanting to set up as a consultant. 
To prove your knowledge you want to start by creating a blog talking about yourself, 
why you are interested in technology and demonstrate how much you know.
For each of the sections below asking you to describe,
include around a paragraph of information about the topic. </h2>
</div>    
<div class="quest"> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business? </div>
<div class="ans">Information technology (IT) has become a vital and integral part of every business plan. From multi-national corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to small businesses that own a single computer, IT plays a role. The reasons for the omnipresent use of computer technology in business can best be determined by looking at how it is being used across the business world.
<ol>
<li>Communication Between Employees, Suppliers and Customers</li>
<p>  or many companies, email is the principal means of communication between employees, suppliers and customers. Email was one of the early drivers of the Internet, providing a simple and inexpensive means to communicate. Over the years, a number of other communications tools have also evolved, allowing staff to communicate using live chat systems, online meeting tools and video-conferencing systems. Voice over internet protocol (VOIP) telephones and smart-phones offer even more high-tech ways for employees to communicate.</p>
<li> Inventory Management Systems</li>
<p> When it comes to managing inventory, organizations need to maintain enough stock to meet demand without investing in more than they require. Inventory management systems track the quantity of each item a company maintains, triggering an order of additional stock when the quantities fall below a pre-determined amount. These systems are best used when the inventory management system is connected to the point-of-sale (POS) system. The POS system ensures that each time an item is sold, one of that item is removed from the inventory count, creating a closed information loop between all departments.</p>
<li> Data Management Systems</li>
<p> he days of large file rooms, rows of filing cabinets and the mailing of documents is fading fast. Today, most companies store digital versions of documents on servers and storage devices. These documents become instantly available to everyone in the company, regardless of their geographical location. Companies are able to store and maintain a tremendous amount of historical data economically, and employees benefit from immediate access to the documents they need.</P>
<li> Management Information Systems </li>
<p> Storing data is only a benefit if that data can be used effectively. Progressive companies use that data as part of their strategic planning process as well as the tactical execution of that strategy. Management Information Systems (MIS) enable companies to track sales data, expenses and productivity levels. The information can be used to track profitability over time, maximize return on investment and identify areas of improvement.</p>
<li>  Customer Relationship Management    </li>
<p> Companies are using IT to improve the way they design and manage customer relationships. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems capture every interaction a company has with a customer, so that a more enriching experience is possible. If a customer calls a call center with an issue, the customer support representative will be able to see what the customer has purchased, view shipping information, call up the training manual for that item and effectively respond to the issue.

The entire interaction is stored in the CRM system, ready to be recalled if the customer calls again. The customer has a better, more focused experience and the company benefits from improved productivity.   </p>

<div class="quest"> 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully â€“ what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?    </div>
<div class="ans"> Seven primary characteristics of a project include:</div>

<ol>
    <li>Objective: Each has a specific goal to reach.</li>
    <li>Schedule: Point in time in which they must be accomplished.</li>
    <li>Complexity: Does the technology exist to achieve the project objectives?</li>
    <li>Size and Nature of Task: Step-by-step plan of action.</li>
    <li>Resources: Labor, personnel, equipment, materials, facilities, etc.</li>
    <li>Organizational Structure: The 'meshing' of project requirements into the existing organization.</li>
    <li>Information and Control Systems: These must be structured to handle problems through the typical lines of authority</li>
</ol>
<p><h4> Project Management:</h4></P>
<p> Initiating the Project</p>
The project management techniques related to the project initiation phase include: 
<ol>

<li>Establishing the project initiation team. This involves organizing team members to assist in carrying out the project initiation activities.</li>
<li>Establishing a relationship with the customer. The understanding of your customer's organization will foster a stronger relationship between the two of you.</li>
<li>Establishing the project initiation plan. Defines the activities required to organize the team while working to define the goals and scope of the project.</li>
<li>Establishing management procedures. Concerned with developing team communication and reporting procedures, job assignments and roles, project change procedure, and how project funding and billing will be handled.</li>
<li>Establishing the project management environment and workbook. Focuses on the collection and organization of the tools that you will use while managing the project. </li>  

<p>Executing the Project</p>
The project management techniques related to the project execution phase include:
<ol>
<li>Executing the baseline project plan. The job of the project manager is to initiate the execution  of project activities, acquire and assign resources, orient and train new team members, keep the project on schedule, and assure the quality of project deliverables.</li>
<li>Monitoring project progress against the baseline project plan. Using Gantt and PERT charts, which will be discussed in detail further on in this paper, can assist the project manager in doing this.</li>
<li>Managing changes to the baseline project plan.</li>
<li>Maintaining the project workbook. Maintaining complete records of all project events is necessary. The project workbook is the primary source of information for producing all project reports.</li>
<li>Communicating the project status. This means that the entire project plan should be shard with the entire project team and any revisions to the plan should be communicated to all interested parties so that everyone understands how the plan is evolving. </li>

<p> Closing Down the Project </p>
<ol>
<li>Link project goals and objectives to stakeholder needs</li>
<li>Focus on customer needs.</li>
<li>Build high-performance project teams.</li>
<li>Work across functional boundaries.</li>
<li>Develop work breakdown structures.</li>
<li>Estimate project costs and schedules.</li>
<li>Meet time constraints.</li>
<li>Calculate risks.</li>
<li>Establish a dependable project control and monitoring system.</li>
</ol>

<p> <h4>DEVELOPMENT TOOLS </h4> </P>
<P>There are tons of Software Development tools and selecting the best could be a challenge. Following is a curated list of the 21 top software development tools.

We have covered Software Development tools in the following categories
<ol>
<li>IDE (Integrated Development Environment)</li>
<P> is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of:
a source code editor
a compiler and/or an interpreter
build automation tools
a debugger.Here are listed below the IDE tools</P>

<li>CodeCharge Studio:</li>
</ol>
<br>

<li>Frameworks</li>
<P> Framework just gives you basic structure around which you will write your code to have the greater functionality of the system.</P>
<P>is an abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality can be selectively overridden or specialized by user code, thus providing specific functionality. Frameworks are a special case of software libraries in that they are reusable abstractions of code wrapped in a well-defined Application programming interface (API), yet they contain some key distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries.
An IDE is an application used to write and compile code. A framework is generally a software component that someone else wrote that you can use/integrate into your own project, generally to avoid re-inventing the wheel

<div class ="quest"> 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects â€“ How does GDPR impact digital projects?  </div>
<div class ="ans"> <p> Copyright
A basic understanding of copyright principles is essential for any blogger, researcher, reporter, photographer, or anyone who publishes their creative works. Itâ€™s important for two reasons. First, you should understand how you can properly make use of someone elseâ€™s work â€“ quoting from it, reprinting it, summarizing it, even satirizing it. And second, you should understand how you can protect your own legal rights in what you create, so that others donâ€™t take unfair (even unlawful) advantage of it.

Like any area of the law, copyright can get complex at its outer limits. However, a working knowledge of copyright law is not hard to acquire and will guide you through nearly all the situations you are likely to face in your day to day work.

What Copyright Covers

Letâ€™s start with some of the building blocks. First, all copyright law is federal law and therefore uniform across the country (in theory). States have no role, because the Constitution gives Congress the sole "power . . . [t]o promote the Progress of Science and the useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries." Congress first exercised this power to establish copyrights (and patents) in its first meeting in 1791, and it has regularly revised and updated the law ever since. Though the last comprehensive copyright revision was enacted in 1976, Congress has passed many new copyright laws and amended others â€“ sometimes after highly contentious lobbying and debate â€“ in the digital era.

Second, copyright law covers an extraordinarily broad range of creative work. The law calls them "works of authorship" but copyright protects almost all creative work that can be written down or otherwise captured in a tangible medium:

Literary works â€“ which is basically prose, whether a news story, scientific paper, novel, poetry, or any other form of "words-only" (or words-and-pictures) creative work.
Musical works â€“ both the lyrics and the music, whether from advertising jingles to symphonies.
Dramatic works â€“ plays, including any accompanying music.
Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works â€“ photographs, drawings, paintings, and any other kind of two- or three-dimensional art.
Motion pictures and other audiovisual works â€“ movies, television shows, YouTube videos, and any kind of multimedia.
Sound recordings â€“ in addition to the copyright on words and music (above) a separate copyright protects a recording artistâ€™s rendition of a work
Architectural works â€“ blueprints and similar plans for buildings.<br>Copyright Ownership

Owning a copyright gives you the exclusive right to publish, copy or otherwise reproduce the work; to distribute the work publicly (or not so publicly); and to perform or display the work, if it is a work of performance or visual art. Owning a copyright also gives you the exclusive right to prepare "derivative works," which are the original works in new forms â€“ for example, a translation into another language, or a movie made from a novel, or a revised or expanded edition of an existing work. Someone who does these things without your permission is infringing your copyright, and the law provides recourse to you. </P>
<p>Who might this be useful for?
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) concerning data protection and privacy is relevant to all organizations working within/to the European Union and the European Economic Area.

How is it best used?
This grid can serve as a reference home for an organisationâ€™s set of documented GDPR processes and records â€“ as used to provide staff with an easy-to-access reference site (to facilitate consistent GDPR-compliant practices) and so that any audit sees a structured, end-to-end system in place.

With this grid (tailored to your specifics â€“ and regularly updated), if you get a GDPR question from a customer â€“ or a request from your lead data protection supervisory authority â€“ you, and your team, can deal with it in minutes.

What does it consist of?
This grid lays out a complete end-to-end GDPR methodology for:

Auditing your business for GDPR compliance â€“ questions to ask and information to capture
Capturing and storing the personal data you process
Documenting the purpose of this data and your legal basis for processing it
Auditing and documenting where you hold this data â€“ internal and external data processors
Noting who controls this data â€“ internal and external data controllers  </P>
