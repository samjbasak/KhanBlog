<h2>   You are wanting to set up as a consultant. 
To prove your knowledge you want to start by creating a blog talking about yourself,

</div> 
<br>   
<div class="quest"> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business? </div>
<div class="ans">Information technology (IT) has become a vital and integral part of every business plan. From multi-national corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to small businesses that own a single computer, IT plays a role. The reasons for the omnipresent use of computer technology in business can best be determined by looking at how it is being used across the business world.
<ol>
<li>Communication Between Employees, Suppliers and Customers</li>
<p> or many companies, email is the principal means of communication between employees, suppliers and customers. Email was one of the early drivers of the Internet, providing a simple and inexpensive means to communicate. Over the years, a number of other communications tools have also evolved, allowing staff to communicate using live chat systems, online meeting tools and video-conferencing systems. Voice over internet protocol (VOIP) telephones and smart-phones offer even more high-tech ways for employees to communicate.</p>
<li> Inventory Management Systems</li>
<p> When it comes to managing inventory, organizations need to maintain enough stock to meet demand without investing in more than they require. Inventory management systems track the quantity of each item a company maintains, triggering an order of additional stock when the quantities fall below a pre-determined amount. These systems are best used when the inventory management system is connected to the point-of-sale (POS) system. The POS system ensures that each time an item is sold, one of that item is removed from the inventory count, creating a closed information loop between all departments.</p>
<li> Data Management Systems</li>
<p> he days of large file rooms, rows of filing cabinets and the mailing of documents is fading fast. Today, most companies store digital versions of documents on servers and storage devices. These documents become instantly available to everyone in the company, regardless of their geographical location. Companies are able to store and maintain a tremendous amount of historical data economically, and employees benefit from immediate access to the documents they need.</P>
<li> Management Information Systems </li>
<p> Storing data is only a benefit if that data can be used effectively. Progressive companies use that data as part of their strategic planning process as well as the tactical execution of that strategy. Management Information Systems (MIS) enable companies to track sales data, expenses and productivity levels. The information can be used to track profitability over time, maximize return on investment and identify areas of improvement.</p>
<li>  Customer Relationship Management    </li>
<p> Companies are using IT to improve the way they design and manage customer relationships. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems capture every interaction a company has with a customer, so that a more enriching experience is possible. If a customer calls a call center with an issue, the customer support representative will be able to see what the customer has purchased, view shipping information, call up the training manual for that item and effectively respond to the issue.

The entire interaction is stored in the CRM system, ready to be recalled if the customer calls again. The customer has a better, more focused experience and the company benefits from improved productivity.   </p>

<div class="quest"> 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?    </div>
<div class="ans"> Seven primary characteristics of a project include:</div>

<ol>
    <li>Objective: Each has a specific goal to reach.</li>
    <li>Schedule: Point in time in which they must be accomplished.</li>
    <li>Complexity: Does the technology exist to achieve the project objectives?</li>
    <li>Size and Nature of Task: Step-by-step plan of action.</li>
    <li>Resources: Labor, personnel, equipment, materials, facilities, etc.</li>
    <li>Organizational Structure: The 'meshing' of project requirements into the existing organization.</li>
    <li>Information and Control Systems: These must be structured to handle problems through the typical lines of authority</li>
</ol>
<p><h4>Project Management:</h4></P>
<p><h5>Initiating the Project</h5></p>
The project management techniques related to the project initiation phase include: 

<ol>
<li>Establishing the project initiation team. This involves organizing team members to assist in carrying out the project initiation activities.</li>
<li>Establishing a relationship with the customer. The understanding of your customer's organization will foster a stronger relationship between the two of you.</li>
<li>Establishing the project initiation plan. Defines the activities required to organize the team while working to define the goals and scope of the project.</li>
<li>Establishing management procedures. Concerned with developing team communication and reporting procedures, job assignments and roles, project change procedure, and how project funding and billing will be handled.</li>
<li>Establishing the project management environment and workbook. Focuses on the collection and organization of the tools that you will use while managing the project. </li>  
</ol>
<p><h5>Executing the Project:</h5></p>
The project management techniques related to the project execution phase include:
<ol>
<li>Executing the baseline project plan. The job of the project manager is to initiate the execution  of project activities, acquire and assign resources, orient and train new team members, keep the project on schedule, and assure the quality of project deliverables.</li>
<li>Monitoring project progress against the baseline project plan. Using Gantt and PERT charts, which will be discussed in detail further on in this paper, can assist the project manager in doing this.</li>
<li>Managing changes to the baseline project plan.</li>
<li>Maintaining the project workbook. Maintaining complete records of all project events is necessary. The project workbook is the primary source of information for producing all project reports.</li>
<li>Communicating the project status. This means that the entire project plan should be shard with the entire project team and any revisions to the plan should be communicated to all interested parties so that everyone understands how the plan is evolving. </li>
</ol>
<p><h5> Closing Down the Project:</h5></p>
<ol>
<li>Link project goals and objectives to stakeholder needs</li>
<li>Focus on customer needs.</li>
<li>Build high-performance project teams.</li>
<li>Work across functional boundaries.</li>
<li>Develop work breakdown structures.</li>
<li>Estimate project costs and schedules.</li>
<li>Meet time constraints.</li>
<li>Calculate risks.</li>
<li>Establish a dependable project control and monitoring system.</li>
</ol>

<p> <h4>DEVELOPMENT TOOLS </h4> </P>
<P>There are tons of Software Development tools and selecting the best could be a challenge. Following is a curated list of the 21 top software development tools.

We have covered Software Development tools in the following categories
<ol>
<li>IDE (Integrated Development Environment)</li>
<P>is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of:
a source code editor
a compiler and/or an interpreter
build automation tools
a debugger.Here are listed below the IDE tools</P>

<li>Spiralogics Application Architecture (SAA)</li>
<li>CodeLobster:</li>
<li>CodeCharge Studio:</li>
</ol>
<br>

<li>Frameworks</li>
<P> Framework just gives you basic structure around which you will write your code to have the greater functionality of the system.</P>
<P>is an abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality can be selectively overridden or specialized by user code, thus providing specific functionality. Frameworks are a special case of software libraries in that they are reusable abstractions of code wrapped in a well-defined Application programming interface (API), yet they contain some key distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries.
An IDE is an application used to write and compile code. A framework is generally a software component that someone else wrote that you can use/integrate into your own project, generally to avoid re-inventing the wheel

<div class ="quest"> 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?  </div>
<div class ="ans"> <p> Copyright
A basic understanding of copyright principles is essential for any blogger, researcher, reporter, photographer, or anyone who publishes their creative works. It’s important for two reasons. First, you should understand how you can properly make use of someone else’s work – quoting from it, reprinting it, summarizing it, even satirizing it. And second, you should understand how you can protect your own legal rights in what you create, so that others don’t take unfair (even unlawful) advantage of it.

Like any area of the law, copyright can get complex at its outer limits. However, a working knowledge of copyright law is not hard to acquire and will guide you through nearly all the situations you are likely to face in your day to day work.

What Copyright Covers

Let’s start with some of the building blocks. First, all copyright law is federal law and therefore uniform across the country (in theory). States have no role, because the Constitution gives Congress the sole "power . . . [t]o promote the Progress of Science and the useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries." Congress first exercised this power to establish copyrights (and patents) in its first meeting in 1791, and it has regularly revised and updated the law ever since. Though the last comprehensive copyright revision was enacted in 1976, Congress has passed many new copyright laws and amended others – sometimes after highly contentious lobbying and debate – in the digital era.

Second, copyright law covers an extraordinarily broad range of creative work. The law calls them "works of authorship" but copyright protects almost all creative work that can be written down or otherwise captured in a tangible medium:

Literary works – which is basically prose, whether a news story, scientific paper, novel, poetry, or any other form of "words-only" (or words-and-pictures) creative work.
Musical works – both the lyrics and the music, whether from advertising jingles to symphonies.
Dramatic works – plays, including any accompanying music.
Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works – photographs, drawings, paintings, and any other kind of two- or three-dimensional art.
Motion pictures and other audiovisual works – movies, television shows, YouTube videos, and any kind of multimedia.
Sound recordings – in addition to the copyright on words and music (above) a separate copyright protects a recording artist’s rendition of a work
Architectural works – blueprints and similar plans for buildings.<br>Copyright Ownership

Owning a copyright gives you the exclusive right to publish, copy or otherwise reproduce the work; to distribute the work publicly (or not so publicly); and to perform or display the work, if it is a work of performance or visual art. Owning a copyright also gives you the exclusive right to prepare "derivative works," which are the original works in new forms – for example, a translation into another language, or a movie made from a novel, or a revised or expanded edition of an existing work. Someone who does these things without your permission is infringing your copyright, and the law provides recourse to you. </P>
<p>Who might this be useful for?
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) concerning data protection and privacy is relevant to all organizations working within/to the European Union and the European Economic Area.

How is it best used?
This grid can serve as a reference home for an organisation’s set of documented GDPR processes and records – as used to provide staff with an easy-to-access reference site (to facilitate consistent GDPR-compliant practices) and so that any audit sees a structured, end-to-end system in place.

With this grid (tailored to your specifics – and regularly updated), if you get a GDPR question from a customer – or a request from your lead data protection supervisory authority – you, and your team, can deal with it in minutes.

What does it consist of?
This grid lays out a complete end-to-end GDPR methodology for:

Auditing your business for GDPR compliance – questions to ask and information to capture
Capturing and storing the personal data you process
Documenting the purpose of this data and your legal basis for processing it
Auditing and documenting where you hold this data – internal and external data processors
Noting who controls this data – internal and external data controllers  </P>

<div class ="quest"> 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites    </div>
<div class = "ans"  > <p> Copyright is legal right that protects the use of your work once your idea has been physically expressed. The current copyright legislation in the UK is the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.
 Copyright law lays out a framework of rules around how that work can be used. It sets out the rights of the owner, as well as the responsibilities of other people who want to use the work. You can do many things with your copyright work including for example copy, change or sell it, share it online or rent it to someone as well as prevent other people from doing those things.                 copyright is a serious crime in modren world.Copying some one design ,information or 
even ideas are subjected to copyright rule.  Copyright protection arises automatically as soon as your work is created. Unlike a patent or trademark, you don’t need to register your work to ensure your rights are protected by copyright. .i will try to avoid these conflicts while designing my website.page.
As a refrence i will try to copy some definitions and explanations from the internet just for educational purpose but not
for the business purpose.
The period your copyright work is protected for depends on a number of factors such as the type of work you have created and when it was made.  For example, when you write a poem your work will be protected until 70 years after your death. But if you act in a play, any rights in your performance are protected for a period of 50 years.</p></div>
<div class ="quest"> 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.
How Different Disabilities Affect Access to the Web? </div>
<div class ="ans"><p>This section describes several general groupings of disabilities, and how they affect access to the Web. There are no universally accepted or absolute categorizations of disability. Disability terminology varies from country to country, and between different disability communities in the same country. Abilities can vary from person to person, or over time, for different people with the same kind of disability. People can have combinations of different limitations, such as a visual and hearing disability together. This particular combination of disabilities is described below.

The term disability itself is also used very generally in this document. Many people with conditions described below would not consider themselves to have disabilities; they may, however, have limitations related to sensory, physical or cognitive functioning which can affect access to the Web. Limitations can include injury-related and aging-related conditions, and can be temporary ,or chronic. An example of an injury-related limitation that is temporary for some people and chronic for others repetitive stress syndrome. There is a trend in some communities away from using medical terminology to describe disability, and a trend in many communities away from using negative terminology or epithets frequently used in the past. This Draft Note does not attempt to comprehensively address these issues of terminology.

Different disabilities sometimes require similar accommodations. For instance, both someone who is blind and someone who cannot use his or her hands require full keyboard support for the commands in browsers and authoring tools, since they both have difficulty using a mouse but can use different assistive technologies to activate commands that are supported by a standard keyboard interface.

The number and severity of disabilities tend to increase as people with age, and may include changes in vision, hearing, memory, or motor function, which can be accommodated on the Web as with any other disabilities.

Many of the accessibility solutions described in this Note contribute to universal designor design for all by benefiting non-disabled users. For example, support for speech output not only benefits blind users, but also Web users whose eyes are busy with other tasks; while captions of audio not only benefit deaf users but also increase the efficiency of indexing and searching audio content on Web sites.

Solutions for the barriers to Web site accessibility described in this section are available in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. Solutions for browser accessibility are available in the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines, and for authoring tool accessibility in the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines.

Visual Disabilities
Blindness
Blindness involves a substantial uncorrectable loss of vision in both eyes.

To access the Web, most individuals who are blind rely on screen readers (software that reads text on the screen with a synthetic voice) and/or refreshable braille displays (a device that dynamically displays lines of text on the screen in braille). Some people who are blind prefer text-based browsers to graphical browsers.

Barriers that people with blindness may encounter on the Web include:
images that do not have alt text
complex images (e.g., graphs or charts) that are not adequately described
video that is not described in text or audio
tables that do not make sense when read serially (in a cell-by-cell mode)
frames that do not have NOFRAME alternatives, or that do not have meaningful names
forms that cannot be tabbed through in a logical sequence, or that are poorly labelled
browsers and authoring tools that lack keyboard support for all commands
browsers and authoring tools that do not use standard applications programmer interfaces for the operating system they are based in
non-standard document formats
Low Vision
There are many types of low vision, including poor acuity (vision that is not sharp), tunnel vision (seeing only the middle of the visual field),
central field loss (seeing only the edges of the visual field), and clouded vision.

To use the Web, some people with low vision use extra-large monitors and increase the size of system fonts and images. Others use screen magnification or screen enhancement software. Some individuals prefer specific combinations of text and background colors, such as a 24-point bright yellow font on a black background, or choose certain typefaces that they find especially legible. 

Barriers that people with low vision may encounter on the Web include:
Web pages with absolute font sizes that do not enlarge easily
Web pages that, because of inconsistent layout, are difficult to navigate when enlarged, due to loss of surrounding context
browsers that do not support user override of authors' style sheets
Color Blindness
Color blindness is a lack of sensitivity to certain colors. Common forms of color blindness include difficulty distinguishing between red and green, or between yellow and blue. Sometimes color blindness results in the inability to perceive any color.

To use the Web, people with color blindness may use their own style sheets to override the font and background color choices of the author.

Barriers that people with color blindness may encounter on the Web include:
color that is used as a unique marker to emphasize text on a Web site
text that inadequately contrasts with background color or patterns
browsers that do not support user override of authors' style sheets
Hearing Disabilities
Deafness
Deafness involves a substantial uncorrectable impairment of hearing in both ears. Some deaf individuals' first language is a sign language, and they may or may not be fluent readers of a written language.

To use the Web, people who are deaf may rely on captions for audio content.

Barriers that people who are deaf may encounter on the Web include:
lack of captions or transcripts for audio content on the Web
lack of visual signposts in pages full of text, which can slow comprehension for non-native readers of a written language
Hard of hearing
A person with a mild to moderate hearing impairment may be considered hard of hearing. 

To use the Web, people who are hard of hearing may rely on captions for audio content together with amplification of audio.

Barriers encountered on the Web include:
lack of captions or transcripts for audio content
Physical Disabilities
Motor
Motor disabilities can include weakness, limitations of muscular control (such as involuntary movements, a lack of coordination, or paralysis), limitations of sensation, joint problems, or missing limbs. Some physical disabilities can include pain which further impedes movement. Any of these conditions can affect the hands and arms as well as other parts of the body.

To use the Web, people with disabilities affecting the hands or arms may use a specialized mouse; a keyboard with a layout of keys that matches their range of motion; a head-mouse, head-pointer, or mouth-stick; voice-recognition software; an eye-gaze system, or other assistive technologies to access and interact with the information on Web sites. They may activate commands by using single keystrokes rather than the simultaneous keystrokes needed to activate commands in some applications. They may need more time when filling out interactive forms on Web sites.

Barriers that people with motor disabilities affecting the hands or arms may encounter include:
browsers and authoring tools that do not support serialized keystrokes for commands
forms that cannot be tabbed through in a logical order
interactive forms with time-limited response options
Speech
Speech disabilities can include difficulty producing speech that is recognizable by some voice recognition software, either in terms of loudness or clarity.

To use parts of the Web that are beginning to rely on voice recognition, someone with a speech disability needs to be able to use an alternate input mode such as text entered via a keyboard.

Barriers that people with speech disabilities encounter on the Web include:
Web sites that require voice-based interaction and have no alternative input mode
Cognitive and Neurological Disabilities
Learning disabilities
Individuals with learning disabilities may have difficulty processing written language or images when read visually, or spoken language when heard, or numbers when read visually or heard. Specific learning disabilities can affect the ability to focus.

To use the Web, people with learning disabilities may rely on getting information through several modalities at the same time. For instance, someone who has difficulty reading may use speech output to facilitate comprehension, while someone with an auditory learning disability may use captions to help understand an audio track. An individual who is highly distractible may need to turn off animations on a site in order to be able to focus on the site's content.

Barriers that people with learning disabilities may encounter on the Web include:
lack of alternative modalities for information on Web sites, for instance lack of alternative text that can be converted to audio to supplement visuals, or the lack of captions for audio
distracting visual or audio elements that cannot easily be turned off
lack of clear and consistent organization of Web sites
Impairments of intelligence
Some individuals learn more slowly or have difficulty understanding complex concepts. 

To use the Web, people with impairments of intelligence may take more time on a Web site, may rely more on graphics to enhance understanding of a site, and may benefit from the level of language on a site not being unnecessarily complex for the site's intended purpose.

Barriers include:
lack of clear or consistent organization of Web sites
use of unnecessarily complex language on Web sites
lack of graphics on Web sites
Memory impairments
Individuals may have memory difficulties for a variety of reasons: for instance problems with short-term memory, missing long-term memory, or loss of language. 

To use the Web, people with memory impairments may rely on a consistent navigational structure throughout the site, and...

Barriers include:
lack of clear or consistent organization of Web sites
Seizure disorders
Some individuals with seizure disorders are triggered by visual flickering or audio signals at a certain frequency. 

To use the Web, people with seizure disorders may turn off animations, blinking text, or audio.

Avoidance of these visual or audio frequencies in Web sites prevents inadvertent triggering of seizures. Barriers include:
use of visual or audio frequencies that can trigger seizures
Psychiatric disabilities
Individuals with mental or emotional disabilities may have difficulty focusing. 

To use the Web, people with psychiatric disabilities may turn off distracting visual or audio elements.

Barriers include:
lack of clear and consistent organization of a Web sites
distracting visual or audio elements
2. Tools
[This section has not been revised yet.]

The following is a list of assistive technologies that some people with disabilities use to browse the Web. Assistive technologies are products used by people with disabilities to help accomplish tasks that they cannot accomplish otherwise or could not do easily otherwise. When dealing with the Web, assistive technologies usually refer to adaptive software, specially designed hardware devices, and or standard devices used in alternative ways to provide access for people with disabilities.

Some assistive technologies rely on output of other user agents, such as graphical desktop browsers, text browsers, voice browsers, multimedia players, plug-ins.

Alternate keyboards or switches
Hardware or software devices, used by people with physical disabilities, that provide an alternate way of creating keystrokes that appear to come from the standard keyboard. Examples include on-screen keyboards, eyegaze keyboards, and sip-and-puff switches. Applications that can be operated entirely from the standard keyboard , with no mouse movements required, support single-switch access or access via alternative keyboards.
Braille and refreshable braille
Braille is a technique involving six to eight dots that are raised in different patterns to represent letters and numbers so that they may be read by people who are blind using their fingertips. Braille systems vary greatly around the world. Some  grades of braille include additional codes beyond standard alpha-numeric characters, to represent common letter groupings (e.g., th, ble, in Grade II American English braille) to make braille more compact. An 8-dot version of braille has been developed to allow all ASCII characters to be represented. Dynamic or refreshable braille involves the use of a mechanical display where dots can be raised and lowered dynamically to allow any braille words to be displayed. 
Only letters and numbers can be represented in braille, although some braille printers have a utility that allows simple graphics to be drawn on a sheet using the raised dots at a resolution of approximately 11 dots per inch.
Screen magnifiers
Software used primarily by individuals with low vision that magnifies a portion of the screen for easier viewing. Note that at the same time screen magnifiers make presentations larger, they also reduce the area of the document that may be viewed. Some screen magnifiers therefore offer two views of the screen: one magnified and one default size for navigation.
Screen readers:
Software used by individuals who are blind or have learning disabilities that interprets what is displayed on a screen, and directs it either to speech synthesis, for audio output, or refreshable braille, for tactile output. Some screen readers use the document tree (i.e., the parsed document) as their input. However, older screen readers make use of the rendered version of a document, meaning that document order or structure may be lost (e.g., when tables are used for layout) and their output may be confusing.
Sound notification
Features of some operating systems that allow deaf or hard of hearing users to receive visual notification that a warning or error sound has been emitted by the computer.
Scanning software
Software used by individuals with some physical or cognitive disabilities that highlights or announces selection choices (e.g., menu items, groups of possible phrases, etc.) one at a time. A user selects a desired item by hitting a switch when the desired item is highlighted or announced.
Voice recognition
Voice recognition is used by people with some physical disabilities or temporary injuries to hands and forearms -- as well as some users interested in greater convenience, and as an input method in some voice browsers. Applications that have full keyboard support can be used with voice recognition.</p></div>
